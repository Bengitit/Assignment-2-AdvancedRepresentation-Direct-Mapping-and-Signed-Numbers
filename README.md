# Notes
This project was alot easier than the last one since alot of the methods where repeated like, the main which I stuggled with last time. Writing conversion was much pretty fun. The hardest was hex to binary, because I decided to group them into 4 which made it much easier. The sign magnitude, ones complement and twos complement was an easy since it was similar to the binarry conversion.
